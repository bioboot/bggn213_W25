## Overview
Bioinformatics - the application of computational and analytical methods to biological problems - is a rapidly maturing field that is driving the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the avalanche of data in modern life sciences and medical research.  

This course is designed for bioscience graduate students and provides a hands-on introduction to the computer-based analysis of genomic and biomolecular data.

Major topics include: 
- Genomic and biomolecular bioinformatic resources,  
- Genome informatics, 
- Structural informatics,  
- Transcriptomics,
- UNIX for bioinformatics, and 
- Bioinformatics data analysis with R.  

A detailed listing of all [course topics]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) is available and includes a guest lecture from a genomic scientist at Illumina Inc., Synthetic Genomics Inc., Human Longevity Inc., or the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology subject to student voting preferences. 


Students completing this course will be able to evaluate new genomic and biomolecular information using existing software and gain experience in combining bioinformatic approaches to answer specific biological questions. Our broader goal is to point towards perspectives that bioinformatics can expose for the integration and analysis of complex biological information. For further details please see our complete list of [course objectives and specific learning goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/goals/).  

## Audience: 
Bioscience graduate students and others familiar with basic molecular biology concepts. No formal programming training or high level mathematical skills are required.  

## Accessibility:  
We are committed to making this course accessible to everybody. Please contact Prof. Grant <bjgrant@ucsd.edu> if you have questions regarding room accessibility.  

## Requirements: 
To fully participate in this course students will be expected to use their own laptop computers with specific freely available [software installed]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/). A limited number of classroom computers are also available should the need arise.    

## Schedule:  
**N.B.** This quarter, BGGN-213 will be offered **in-person only** on Wednesday and Friday at 1:00 - 4:00 pm in TATA 2501 ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/Cd8z9Zexx6q){:target="_blank"}).  Additional video lectures, screencast lab review sessions and supporting material will be available via this website on a weekly basis throughout the quarter.  A detailed [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) with class related material is provided online.  

## Class announcements:  
All announcements regarding the course will be by email to your UCSD address.  We will also be using [Piazza]({{site.data.authors.corelinks.piazza}}){:target="_blank"} to facilitate course communication, particularly around questions and answers. If you have a question outside of class or office hours, first check if it has already been asked on Piazza and if not post there. If you have a question or concern you donâ€™t feel comfortable posting on Piazza feel free to reach out via email.  

## Office hours:  
We will have in-person and [Zoom](https://ucsd.zoom.us/){:target="_blank"} office hours on a weekly basis at a time to be determined from student polling. For now email me for a time and we will make it happen.
    

## Textbook:  
There is no textbook for the course. Lecture notes, homework assignments, grading criteria, pre-class screen casts and required reading material will be available from this public facing course website.  

## Syllabus:  
A detailed [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl}}{{site.data.authors.corelinks.syllabus}}){:.no-push-state} with topic outlines and learning goals is available for download.

## Surveys:
Please help us improve this course by completing by completing these surveys before and after the course. Thank you!
* [Pre-course questionnaire]({{ site.data.authors.corelinks.questionnaire }})  
* [Post-course questionnaire]({{ site.baseurl }}/404/)  

## Acknowledgments:
In addition to working on personal laptops we will also be using remote supercomputing resources for analyzing bioinformatics data at scale. Our use of these resources is kindly supported by [NSF/XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) grant allocation TG-BIO170077.

To further support learning data analysis with the R environment we gratefully acknowledge support from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). DataCamp are providing our enrolled students with access to over 300 hours of data science videos and interactive coding challenges aimed at strengthening their data science skills.
